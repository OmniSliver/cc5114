## Tests

All tests use JUnit4.
The tests are in their own classes, in the tests folder, in the same package as the class they are testing.
They can be run in [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/home/) with the Run command (Ctrl+F11). There are [alternatives](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Test-runners).
