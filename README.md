# CC5114 assignments
## Classes
- [Perceptrons](CC5114/src/cl/cc5114/perceptron)
- [Binary sum gate](CC5114/src/cl/cc5114/binarySumGate)
- [Learning perceptron example](CC5114/src/cl/cc5114/GuessSemiPlane.java)
- [Sigmoid Neuron](CC5114/src/cl/cc5114/sigmoidNeuron)
## Tests
- All tests use JUnit4.
- The tests are in their own classes, in the tests folder, in the same package as the class they are testing.
- They can be run in [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/home/) with the Run command (Ctrl+F11). There are [alternatives](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Test-runners).
